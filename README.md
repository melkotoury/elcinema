**This is a test for Elcinema**

Let's be clear first that implementing _Stack_ in _Linkedlist_ is better in performance while doing _insertion_ and deletion _O(1)_ vs _O(n)_ in _array_

Performance in array is quite better in _accessing_ or _indexing_ _O(1)_ vs _O(n)_ in _Linkedlist_

In calculating the max , I used _Merge Sort_

**Merge Sort** is the fastest stable sorting algorithm with worst-case complexity of O(nlogn), but it requires extra space.
